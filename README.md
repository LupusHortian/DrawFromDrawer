Missing some feathers when crafting arrows? Check in the drawer, maybe there is some. When using a worbench, the contents of its drawer are treated as if it's in the player's inventory. Craft more, craft free, with less micromanagement involved.
This, however, doesn't extend on tools. Tools still must be in the inventory.

### Update v0.7.1

- Minor fix for powder components.

### Update v0.7.0

- Recipes that have liquid and powder items now also work.

### Update v0.6.0

- Updated for 2.25
- Ammo Work Bench is now supported. Quadruple your drawing power with two double volume drawers in it.
